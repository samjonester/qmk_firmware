# Sam's Planck layout

This layout is heavily based on the default Planck layout, with the following notable changes.

- Adds a dedicated right shift to support alternate shifting.
- Moves enter to the right "space key" since I use it frequently while chatting, and don't want right shift pulling double duty.
- Replaces Fn with a dedicated undo key.
- Raise becomes all about numbers.
  - Numbers are moved to the home row.
  - Shifted number symbols are placed above their traditional number to not break too much muscle memory
  - Mathematical operators are placed on this row below numbers.
  - Navigation is easily accessible and placed above arrows
- Lower becomes all about brackets
  - One of my biggest annoyances on a traditional keyboard is the random placement of brackets, which relies so heavily on pinkie contortion.
  - This layer puts brackets on the home row, along with a few other oft used programming symbols.
- Adjust is refined to provide only the keyboard adjustments which I use.
